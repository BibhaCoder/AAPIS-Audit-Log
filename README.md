# AAPIS™ Daily Audit Log
### Institutional-Grade Analytics Transparency

This repository contains the daily cryptographic audit trail for the **Accelerated-Indexing (AAPIS™)** benchmark index analytics.

## How it Works
1.  **Daily Computation:** Every market day after close, our AAPIS™ data analytics platform finalizes the day's data output.
2.  **Cryptographic Hashing:** A SHA-256 hash is generated using the daily output combined with a private secure salt.
3.  **Immutable Verification:** This hash is automatically published to this public repository, creating a permanent, verifiable timestamp of our data.

## Why We Do This
Through the AAPIS™ platform, we deliver a rigorous **Proof of Process**. This dual-layer architecture ensures data sovereignty and mathematical accountability:

* **Public Accountability:** Stakeholders can use these cryptographic hashes to verify the integrity and immutability of our historical outputs.
* **Private Verification:** Ambika Analytics LLC maintains a **restricted-access private repository** containing the raw datasets and computation logs. This serves as the "source of truth" for formal audit verification and regulatory due diligence.
* **IP Protection:** This system allows us to provide a verifiable audit trail while keeping our proprietary model logic and sensitive raw data secure and confidential.
