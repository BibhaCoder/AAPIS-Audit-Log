# AAPIS™ Daily Audit Log
### Institutional-Grade Analytics Transparency

This repository contains the daily cryptographic audit trail for the **Accelerated-Indexing (AAPIS™)** benchmark analytics.

#### How it works:

- **Daily Computation:** Every trading day at 4:05 PM ET, our analytics engine finalizes the day's data output.

- **Cryptographic Hashing:** A SHA-256 hash is generated using the daily output combined with a private secure salt.

- **Immutable Verification:** This hash is automatically published to a public repository, creating a permanent, verifiable timestamp of our data.

#### Why we do this:
This process provides **Proof of Process**. It allows third parties to verify our historical analytics outputs without us having to reveal our proprietary and copyrighted model logic.
