This repository contains the daily cryptographic audit trail for the **Accelerated-Indexing (AAPIS™)** benchmark analytics.

### How it Works
* **Daily Computation:** Every market day after close, our AAPIS™ data analytics platform finalizes the day's data output.
* **Cryptographic Hashing:** A `SHA-256` hash is generated using the daily output combined with a private secure salt.
* **Immutable Verification:** This hash is automatically published to this public repository, creating a permanent, verifiable timestamp of our data.

### Why We Do This
Through the AAPIS™ platform, we deliver a rigorous **Proof of Process**. Stakeholders can verify the integrity of our historical data outputs while our proprietary model logic stays secure and confidential.
